# What are Mixed Models?

In simple words, the rationale behind mixed models is the simultaneous presence of components that model the EXPECTED VALUE (fixed) as well as the VARIANCE (random).

Specifically, today we are going to cover LINEAR MIXED MODELS, which make the following assumptions [@Bolker_etal_2022]:

-   The **expected values** of the responses are **linear combinations** of the fixed predictor variables and the random effects.

-   The conditional distribution of the variable response is Gaussian (equivalently, the errors are Gaussian or "Normal").

-   The random effects are normally distributed. Normally, we assume that the expected value of a random effect is equal to zero, but with a positive variance.

For more information about more types of mixed models and what options we have available in R, please, check out the new [CRAN Task View: Mixed, Multilevel, and Hierarchical Models in R](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/MixedModels.html).

# Why TIDY?

Well, from the hand of [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/), the tidy data framework changed the way we code and work in R for data science. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure [@wickham2014]:

-   Each variable is a column,

-   Each observation is a row, and

-   Each value have its own cell.

This workflow has been created using [mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/)

# THE CODE

## What do you need?

For a complete experience, I recommend you download and install the:

-   [Latest version of R](https://www.r-project.org/)

-   [Latest version of RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

## What is Quarto?

We are going to explore the new features offered by [Quarto](https://quarto.org) documents (\*.qmd).

![](images/quarto.png)

Quarto is a refined version (and successor) of [R-markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). It is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/). It allows to combine R, Python, Julia, and Java (Observable JS) for the design of reports, applications, websites, blogs, scientific publications, and more...

```

Among many packages we are going to use today, there is one from the [tidymodels family](https://www.tidymodels.org/) that was specially designed to convert statistical objects into tidy format: the *broom* package [@broom]. Particularly for mixed models, we will also need its `spinoff`: the *broom.mixed* package [@broom.mixed] .

[![](images/logo-01.png){width="168"}](https://broom.tidymodels.org/)

The broom package offer three key functions to manipulate models' outcomes:

-   `glance()` to report information about the entire model

-   `tidy()` to summarize information about model components, and

-   `augment()` to add information about observations to a dataset

# 01. SPLIT-PLOT

Split-plot arrangement is frequently used in experiments including several factors (factorial). The main characteristic is that the arrangement follows a hierarchy: there main plots (a.k.a. whole plots) covering one of the factors, and then there are "subplots" within each level of the main that include levels of a second factor, and so on. Therefore, the main plot serves as a "block" for the subplots, and thus, we are setting boundaries to ("restricting") the randomization of the subplot factor.

::: callout-important
-   DESIGN: We intentionally call split-plot "arrangement" because they can fit into multiple "designs" such as completely randomized (CRD), randomized complete blocks design (RCBD), or latin-squares design (LSD).

-   INFERENCE POWER: What happens with split-plot design is that the main plot has less degrees of freedom than the factor at the subplot, and thus, we have more inference power at the factor in the subplot hierarchy. So consider this before it's too late!
:::

## Create a split-plot design

The *agricolae* package [@agricolae] brings a set very useful functions to generate different experimental designs, among them the split-plot. Let's see an example:

```{r agricolae}

# Example with agricolae

# Define plots
mainplot <- c(0,50,80,110,140)
subplot <- c("Var_1", "Var_2", "Var_3")

# Produce
sp_design <- agricolae::design.split(trt1 = mainplot, trt2 = subplot, 
                        design = "rcbd", r = 3, 
                        randomization = TRUE, seed = 4561)

```

## i. Data

```{r split_plot_data}

# Read csv
split_plot_data_0 <- read.csv(file = "../data/01_split_plot_data.csv", header = TRUE)

# Data hierarchy
split_plot_data <- 
  split_plot_data_0 %>% 
  mutate(NRATE = factor(NRATE)) %>% 
  # Identify Main Plot
  # mutate(main = factor(BLOCK:NRATE)) %>% 
  dplyr::select(BLOCK, NRATE, VARIETY, YIELD)

```

## ii. Dig the data

Now, let's use several functions to explore the data.

For example, the `glimpse()` function from dplyr allows to take a quick look to the columns in our data frame (it's like a transposed version of `print()`)

```{r glimpse}

# Glimpse from dplyr
dplyr::glimpse(split_plot_data)

```

Then, the `skim()` function from the skimr package allows to take a deeper look to all the variables (columns), creating a quick summary that reports the presence of missing values, etc., etc.

```{r skimr}

# Skim from skimr
skimr::skim(split_plot_data)

```

## iii. Models

For the analysis of split-plot designs we basically need to specify an error term that otherwise the model will not see: the MAIN PLOT ERROR TERM (see Venables and Ripley (2002), pg. 283). By default, the random term that the computer will identify is the one happening at the lowest level in the hierarchy (replication). However, we need to specify that the main plot serves as a kind of block to the design.

### a. nlme::lme

```{r sp_nlme}

# Model without split component
no_split <- nlme::lme(# Response variable
                 YIELD ~
                   # Fixed
                   0 + NRATE*VARIETY,
                   # Random error of MAINPLOT (NRATE nested in BLOCK)
                   random = ~1|BLOCK, 
                   # Data
                   data = split_plot_data,
                   # Method
                   method = "REML")

# Model with split component
split_nlme <- nlme::lme(# Response variable
                 YIELD ~
                   # Fixed (Removing intercept? Why?)
                   0 + NRATE*VARIETY,
                   # Random error of MAINPLOT (NRATE nested in BLOCK)
                   random = ~1|BLOCK/NRATE, 
                   # Data
                   data = split_plot_data,
                   # Method
                   method = "REML")

# Type 3 (when interaction is present)
Anova(no_split, type = 3)

# Let's see the difference between models in terms of DFs
# summary(no_split)
# summary(split_nlme)

```

### b. lmer code (lme4)

```{r sp_lme4}

split_lme4 <- lme4::lmer(# Response variable
                   YIELD ~ 
                   # Fixed (Removing intercept? Why?)
                   0+NRATE*VARIETY +
                   # Random
                   (1|BLOCK/NRATE), 
                   # Data
                   data=split_plot_data)

# Type 3
Anova(split_lme4, type = 3)

```

## iv. Check assumptions

```

## v. Comparisons

```{r sp_comparisons}


# Estimate the comparisons (pairwise)
split_lm4_comparisons <-  
  split_lme4 %>% 
  # ~ specifies the level of comparison (marginal or interaction)
  # Since interaction was significant we specify ~ Interaction (Factor1*Factor2)

      by = "VARIETY", 
      # Order
      decreasing = TRUE, details=FALSE, reversed=TRUE, 
      # Specs
      alpha=0.05,  adjust = "tukey", Letters=LETTERS)


```

# 02. REPEATED MEASURES

Now, we are going to reproduce the analysis I've done for one of my papers [@correndo2021]. Particularly, we are going to reproduce [**Figure 2**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-90297-1#Fig2)

![](images/paste-26DDB04C.png)

For this paper, we have data from 4 different locations. We tested the levels of soil potassium fertility, hereinafter as soil test K (STK), in long-term experiments (2000-2009) where the treatments of interest were: (i) Control (unfertilized), (ii) NPS (fertilized with NPS), and (iii) Pristine conditions (No Ag-history).

At each plot/sample, the STK was measured at five-consecutive soil depths (0-20, 20-40, 40-60, 60-80, and 80-100 cm). Thus, they we took "repeated measurements" over the space.

We were NOT interested in comparing locations since they had very different previous history, and crop rotation, so confounding effects may have obscured the inference. Therefore, location\|site was not a factor under consideration, and all the analysis were fitted independently by site.

## i. Data

```{r rm_data}

# Read file
data <- 
  read_excel("../data/02_repeated_measures_data.xlsx", col_names = TRUE) %>% 
  # Create PLOT column to identify subject (Exp. Unit for Rep. Measures)
  unite(PLOT, BLOCK,TREAT, sep = "_", remove=FALSE) %>%
  # OR
  # Identify Subplot
  ungroup() %>% 
  group_by(BLOCK, TREAT) %>% 
  # Create plot ID # Needed for Repeated Measures
  mutate(plot = cur_group_id(), .after = PLOT) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(DEPTH = as.factor(DEPTH),
         depth = as.integer(DEPTH), # Needed for CorAR1
         BLOCK = factor(BLOCK),
         SITE = factor(SITE),
         TREAT = factor(TREAT),
         # Create a grouping variable (WHY?) # Needed for HetVar
         GROUP = case_when(TREAT == "Pristine" ~ "Pristine",
                           TRUE ~ "Agriculture")
         )

```

## ii. Dig the data

Now, let's use several functions to explore the data.

First, the `glimpse()` function from dplyr

```{r rm_glimpse}

# Glimpse from dplyr
dplyr::glimpse(data)

```

Then, the `skim()` function from skmir

```{r rm_skimr}
# Skim from skimr
skimr::skim(data)

```

```{r rm_ggplot}

# Boxplot
data %>% 
  dplyr::select(-depth) %>% 
  # Plot
ggplot() + 
  # Boxplots
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = reorder(DEPTH, desc(DEPTH)), y = STK, fill = TREAT))+
  # Plot by site
  facet_wrap(~SITE)+
  # Flip axes
  coord_flip()+
  scale_x_discrete()+
  tidybayes::theme_tidybayes()

```

## iii. Candidate Models

I'm sorry for this, but the most important step is ALWAYS to write down the model.

### a. Formulae

#### m0. Block Fixed

In a traditional approach blocks are defined as fixed, affecting the mean of the expected value. Yet there is no consensus about treating blocks as fixed or as random. For more information, read @Dixon_2016.

Let's define the model. For simplification (and avoid writing interaction terms), here we are going to consider that $\tau_i$ is the "treatment".

$$ y_{ij} = \mu + \tau_i + \beta_j + \epsilon_{ij} $$

$$ \epsilon_{ij} \sim N(0, \sigma^2_{e} )$$ where $\mu$ represents the overall mean (if intercept is used), $\tau_i$ is the effect of treatment-j over $\mu$, $\beta_j$ is the effect of block-j over $\mu$, and $\epsilon_{ij}$ is the random effect of each experimental unit.

```{r block_fixed}
# SIMPLEST MODEL
fit_block_fixed <- function(x){
  lm(# Response variable
     STK ~ 
       # Fixed
       TREAT + DEPTH + TREAT:DEPTH + BLOCK,
     # Data
     data = x)
  }
```

#### m1. Block Random

An alternative approach is considering a MIXED MODEL, where blocks are considered "random". Basically, we add a term to the model that it is expected to show a "null" overall effect over the mean of the variable of interest but introduces "noise". By convention, a random effect is expected to have an expected value equal to zero but a positive variance as follows: $$ y_{ij} = \mu + \tau_i + \beta_j + \epsilon_{ij} $$ $$ \beta_j \sim N(0, \sigma^2_{b} )$$ $$ \epsilon_{ij} \sim N(0, \sigma^2_{e} )$$ Similar than before, $\mu$ represents the overall mean (if intercept is used), $\tau_i$ is the effect of treatment-j over $\mu$, $\beta_j$ is the "random" effect of block-j over $\mu$, and $\epsilon_{ij}$ is the random effect of each experimental unit.

So what's the difference? Simply specifying this component: $$ \beta_j \sim N(0, \sigma^2_b) $$, which serves to model the variance.

How do we write that?

```{r block_random}
# RANDOM BLOCK
fit_block_random <- function(x){
  nlme::lme(
    # Fixed
    STK ~ TREAT + DEPTH + TREAT:DEPTH,
    # Random
    random = ~1|BLOCK,
    # Data
    data = x)
  }
```

### Models w/ correlated ERRORS

Until here all sounds easy. However, we are (potentially) missing a key component. All measures involving DEPTH have been taken from the same "subjects" (experimental units/plots). So we do have "repeated measures" over space. Thus, it is highly likely that using depth implies the need to adjust the error correlation and covariance structure. Let's explore some options...

#### m2. m1 + CompSymm

Compound symmetry is the simplest covariance structure, where we include a within-subject correlated errors. It is basically the same we do with including BLOCKS as random. We are telling the model that the observations within a given "depth" "share" something, they have something in common (the error).

```{r comp_symm}
# RANDOM BLOCK w/compound symmetry error correlation structure
fit_corsymm <- function(x){
  lme(# Response Variable
      STK ~
        # Fixed
        TREAT + DEPTH + TREAT:DEPTH,
        # Random
        random = ~1|BLOCK,
        # Identify subject where repeated measure happens
        # Plots nested within blocks.
        correlation = corCompSymm(form = ~ DEPTH |BLOCK/PLOT), 
     # Data   
     data=x) }
```

#### m3. m1 + CorAR1

The autoregressive of first order structure (CorAR1) considers correlations dependent of the "distance". Thus, correlation of error is expected to be the highest between adjacent depths (e.g. 0-20 and 20-40 cm), and a systematically decrease with the distance. For example, the correlation between depth 1 and depth 2 would be $\rho^{depth_2-depth_1}$, and then less and less, ending with the correlation between depth 5 and depth 1 equal to $\rho^{depth_5-depth_1}$.

::: callout-caution
An important detail here is that CorAR1 structure is only applicable for evenly spaced intervals!
:::

```{r CorAR1}
# RANDOM BLOCK w/ auto-regressive of 1st order as error correlation structure
fit_ar1 <- function(x){lme(STK ~ TREAT + DEPTH + TREAT:DEPTH,
                       random = ~1|BLOCK,
                       correlation=corAR1(form=~depth|BLOCK/PLOT),
                       data=x)}

```

#### m4. m3 + HetVar

Did you know that we can "relax" the assumption about homogeneity of variance? Oftentimes we have data that shows different variability depending on the level of a given factor or variable.

In the STK dataset, we observed that the "Pristine" treatment (or agriculture condition) present a higher variability compared to Control and NPS treatments, probably linked to higher values of STK. Variance is modeled by adding a "weight". This "weight" could be a function of a continuous variable (e.g. fertilizer rate?) or, like in our case, based on a "categorical" variable.

```{r het_var}
# RANDOM BLOCK w/compound symmetry error correlation structure + Heterogeneous Variance
fit_corsymm_hetvar <- function(x){
  lme(# Response variable
      STK ~ 
        # Fixed
        TREAT + DEPTH + TREAT:DEPTH,
        # Random  
        random = ~1|BLOCK,
        # Correlation
        correlation = corCompSymm(form = ~ depth |BLOCK/PLOT),
        # Variance
        weights = varComb(varIdent(form=~1|GROUP)),
      # Data
      data=x) }

```

### b. Fit

Run the candidate models

```{r rm_fit}


STK_models <- 
  data %>% 
  # Let's group data to run multiple locations|datasets at once
  group_by(SITE) %>% 
  # Store the data per location using nested arrangement
  nest() %>% 
  # BLOCK as FIXED 
  mutate(model_0 = map(data, fit_block_fixed)) %>% 
  # BLOCK as RANDOM
  mutate(model_1 = map(data, fit_block_random)) %>% 
  # COMPOUND SYMMETRY
  mutate(model_2 = map(data, fit_corsymm)) %>% 
  # AUTO-REGRESSIVE ORDER 1
  mutate(model_3 = map(data, fit_ar1)) %>% 
  # COMPOUND SYMMETRY + HETEROSKEDASTIC
  mutate(model_4 = map(data,  fit_corsymm_hetvar) ) %>%
    
  # Data wrangling
  pivot_longer(cols = c(model_0:model_4), # show alternative 'contains' model
               names_to = "model_id",
               values_to = "model") %>% 
  # Map over model column
  mutate(results = map(model, broom.mixed::augment )) %>% 
  # Performance
  mutate(performance = map(model, broom.mixed::glance )) %>% 
  # Extract AIC
  mutate(AIC = map(performance, ~.x$AIC)) %>% 
  # Extract coefficients
  mutate(coef = map(model, ~coef(.x))) %>% 
  # Visual-check plots
  mutate(checks = map(model, ~performance::check_model(.))) %>% 
  ungroup()

```

### c. Check

Checking assumptions is always important. To learn more about data exploration, tools to detect outliers, heterogeneity of variance, collinearity, dependence of observations, problems with interactions, among others, I highly recommend reading [@Zuur_etal_2010].

```{r rm_check}
# Extracting by site
site_1_models <- STK_models %>% dplyr::filter(SITE == "site_1")
site_2_models <- STK_models %>% dplyr::filter(SITE == "site_3")
site_3_models <- STK_models %>% dplyr::filter(SITE == "site_4")
site_4_models <- STK_models %>% dplyr::filter(SITE == "site_2")

```

::: panel-tabset
## Site 1

```{r}
#| fig.height: 10
#| fig.width: 6
(site_1_models %>% dplyr::filter(model_id == "model_0"))$checks[[1]]

```

## Site 2

```{r}
#| fig.height: 10
#| fig.width: 6

(site_2_models %>% dplyr::filter(model_id == "model_0"))$checks[[1]]

```

## Site 3

```{r}
#| fig.height: 10
#| fig.width: 6

(site_3_models %>% dplyr::filter(model_id == "model_0"))$checks[[1]]

```

## Site 4

```{r}
#| fig.height: 10
#| fig.width: 6

(site_4_models %>% dplyr::filter(model_id == "model_0"))$checks[[1]]

```
:::

### d. Selection

Compare models performance

```{r rm_selection}
# Visual model selection
best_STK_models <- 
  STK_models %>% 
  group_by(SITE) %>% 
  mutate(best_model = case_when(AIC == min(as.numeric(AIC)) ~ "Yes",
                                TRUE ~ "No")) %>% 
  ungroup()

# Plot
best_STK_models %>% 
  ggplot()+
  geom_point(aes(x = model_id, y = as.numeric(AIC), color = best_model))+
  facet_wrap(~SITE)

# Final models
selected_models <- best_STK_models %>% dplyr::filter(best_model == "Yes")

```

### e. ANOVA

Estimate the effects of factors under study (and their interaction)

```{r rm_anova}

models_effects <- 
  selected_models %>%
  # Type 3 Sum of Squares (Partial SS)
  mutate(ANOVA = map(model, ~Anova(., type = 3)) )

# Extract ANOVAS
models_effects$ANOVA[[1]]

```

## iv. Means comparison

```{r rm_comparison}
# MULTCOMPARISON
# emmeans and cld multcomp
# We need to specify ourselves the most important interaction to perform the comparisons
mult_comp <- 
  models_effects %>% 
  # Comparisons estimates (emmeans)
  mutate(mc_estimates = map(model, ~emmeans(., ~ TREAT*DEPTH))) %>% 
  # Assign letters and p-value adjustment (multcomp)
  mutate(mc_letters = 
           map(mc_estimates, 
               ~as.data.frame( 
                 # By specifies a strata or level to assign the letters
                 cld(., by = "DEPTH", decreasing = TRUE, details=FALSE,
                     reversed=TRUE, alpha=0.05,  adjust = "tukey", Letters=LETTERS))))


```

## v. Plot

Now, we are going to reproduce [**Figure 2**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-90297-1#Fig2)

```{r rm_plot}

# Create data frame for plot

**Figure 2**. Soil profiles of STK ($g m^{-2}$) under three different conditions: pristine soils (green circles), under grain cropping from 2000 to 2009 with no fertilizers added (Control, orange triangles), and under grain cropping from 2000 to 2009 with N, P, plus S fertilization (NPS, purple diamonds). Overlapping error bars indicate absence of significant differences between scenarios by soil depths combinations (Tukey's HSD, p \< 0.05).

# 03. ADDING REFERENCES

## i. Citations

Adding references with Quarto has become quite easy. Let's see...

-   Using a **"\*.bib" file**: Figures were produced using the ggplot2 package [@ggplot_book]. Models check were tested with the performance package [@performance_paper].

-   Using **Footnotes**: For example, this is some text with a Footnote[^1], this is a second Footnote[^2]

-   Using **visual editor**: this option introduced by Quarto is simply awesome! 🤩. Let's see. **Insert -\> Citation** or "**Crtl + Shift + F8**". With this option we can look for citations online via DOI, Crossref, etc... and insert them into our document (and to our \*.bib file).
